"""
The Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment

The aim of AMUSE is to provide a software framework, in which existing codes for 
dynamics, stellar evolution, hydrodynamics and radiative transfer can easily be 
coupled, in order to perform state-of-the-art simulations of a wide range of 
different astrophysical phenomena.

It contains several packages, most notably (help available for each of these):
units     - AMUSE uses quantities, i.e. a number or array with a unit attached, 
            instead of just numbers (vital when coupling different codes!)
datamodel - defines particles and grids, on which data (quantities) can be stored
ic        - a collection of routines to generate initial conditions
io        - 
community - 


AMUSE contains a lot of functionality to execute astrophysical experiments.
Look into the interface packages for the interfacing to physical model simulation software.
You can also use AMUSE to convert common data formats.
