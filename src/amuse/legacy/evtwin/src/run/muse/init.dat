This init.dat file is tailored to be used with MUSE. This means that it is
somewhat optimised for speed. In particular:
 - All relaxation options and polishing options are disabled. This has a
   detrimental effect on code stability, though there are still some recovery
   options in the code.
 - Quadratic predictions are not used, because the extra data needed by the
   code is not stored in the MUSE structure (this can/should be fixed)
 - The older Pols&al. (1995) opacity tables are used (KOP=1)
 - KION=2, so only ionisation of H and He is calculated in detail
 - Timestep control is set to give a larger timestep during first dredgeup
   and near the end of the main sequence. We do not include timestep
   control near RLOF because this depends on static data that is not saved
   on a star-by-star basis (the same holds for RLOF, but there it is likely
   to be less important).
   Both of these should be fixed, however.
 - Neither the rotational period nor the moment of inertia are solved for to
   reduce the number of equations to be solved for. This affects code stability
   in an unpredictable way: some models have more problems converging with
   the default number of iterations because large errors in the other equations
   are not spread out over as many functions and the code fails to meet the
   EPS limit. All this really means is that the method for estimating the error
   is very crude.
 - To compensate for the above, KR2 is increased from the standard value of 5
   to 10.
 - The lower limit of iterations to show, KT5, is set very high to supress 
   intermediate output from the solver. For a similar reason, KT1 and KSV are
   set very high, altough there should never be output generated from these
   anyway.
