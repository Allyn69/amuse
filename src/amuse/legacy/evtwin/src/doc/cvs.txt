Some important CVS commands.

Note that most of these commands use the option -z6. This means that cvs will
use gzip compression level 6 when transfering files. This can increase the speed
of operation over a network.
At all times, cvs --help will give a brief summary of options. This is context
sensitive, so you can do cvs --help diff to get help on the diff command.

Checkout the CVS repository (initial):
--------------------------------------
Remote (requires login):

cvs -z6 -d :ext:glebbeek@hst34243.phys.uu.nl:/home/strknd/glebbeek/cvsroot checkout stars
or
cvs -z6 -d :ext:naam@venus.phys.uu.nl:/kasper/strknd/glebbeek/cvsroot checkout stars

Local:

cvs -z6 -d /home/strknd/glebbeek/cvsroot checkout stars


Update the local CVS tree (from within the stars directory):
------------------------------------------------------------
cvs -z6 update -Pd
or, if you do not want to update the directory tree as well:
cvs -z6 update


Switching to a specific branch:
-------------------------------
cvs -z6 update -rbranch
Typical values for branch might be v2005_0, v2005_1 or HEAD. HEAD is always the
`current' branch.

CVS history browsing:
---------------------
cvs -z6 history
cvs -z6 log
There's a python script, cvs2cl.pl, that translates the raw CVS changelog to a
more useful ChangeLog file. It is located in the tools/ directory.

Diffing the local tree to the CVS repository:
---------------------------------------------
cvs -z6 diff -u [files] > patch.diff
Always use -u to generate a context diff: this is easier to inspect and modify
by hand.

Applying patches:
-----------------
patch -p0 < patch.diff
Or reverse a patch:
patch -p0 -R < patch.diff
