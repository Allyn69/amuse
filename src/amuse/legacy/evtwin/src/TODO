 * Cleanup differential rotation/rotational mixing in code
 
 * Convert the code to using a staggered mesh

 * Convert scheme for calculating fp and ft to fully implicit (may need an extra
   equation for the psi integral)

 * Fix detection of presence of symbolic links. Right now, it doesn't work
   properly for overriding output fort.nnn files.
   
 * Add He3 to the structure part

 * Check detection of when to break a FUDGED_SOLVER loop and rewrite the check
   so that it is really "floating point safe"

 * Merge nucleosynthesis code from Richard - with proper boundary conditions
