# This makefile header is used by all of the mesa modules.

# READ THIS FIRST.

# If you are just getting started, you should use this file as is,
# except for possibly changing the compiler (step 1 below).

# If you discover that your system doesn't support isnan,
# then you'll also need to do step 2.

# The other steps are for "fine-tuning" and can be tried later.




#################################################################


# step 1) specify your compiler

# pick one of the following options:

# Intel
#FC = ifort

# GNU
#FC = gfortran
# NOTE to gfortran users: make sure you have a recent version.
# I believe that gcc 4.3.0 or 4.4.0 or newer will work okay.
# The failure mode is an infinite loop during installation of mtx.
# So if your installation seems to be hung, try a new gfortran.


# Portland Group Fortran 90/95 compiler
#FC = pgf90
# NOTE: pgf90 is not (yet) supported. 
# If you can get it to work with mesa, please let me know.


# NAG
#FC = f95
# NOTE: NAG f95 is not (yet) supported. 
# If you can get it to work with mesa, please let me know.


# g95 isn't on the list because it doesn't support OpenMP,
# and until it does, it won't be a supported option for mesa.

# otherwise, if your compiler isn't listed, you can add it by
# supplying a block of definitions in the list of conditionals
# at the end of this file.  (BTW: please send us the settings!)



# if you need special flags for the compiler, define them here:
SPECIAL_FC_FLAGS = 




#################################################################


# step 2) specify whether isnan is supported or not

# pick one of the following options:

UTILS_ISNAN = utils_isnan_okay
#UTILS_ISNAN = utils_isnan_nope

# If you aren't sure, try setting UTILS_ISNAN = utils_isnan_okay
# If this works, great.  Otherwise, the compilation of the
# mesa/utils module will complain when it tries to invoke isnan.
# In case that happens, you can simply change this makefile_header
# to the UTILS_ISNAN = utils_isnan_nope setting and redo the
# ./install command for mesa.

# step 3) specify which BLAS and LAPACK libraries to use for mesa/mtx

# LAPACK is a set of "high-level" linear algebra routines,
# such as routines to solve the matrix equation A*x=b.
# The routines in LAPACK call the routines in BLAS.
# BLAS is the set of the "basic linear algebra routines".
# The performance of the matrix operations depends heavily
# on the quality of the BLAS implementation.
# If you are going to do a lot of matrix banging, you should
# get yourself an optimized BLAS. You can get the Goto BLAS here:
# http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/resources/software/

# there are 3 typical ways for setting up BLAS and LAPACK for mesa:
# 1) use an optimized library that has both LAPACK and BLAS.
# 2) use an optimized library for BLAS and compile LAPACK routines from sources.
# 3) compile both BLAS and LAPACK routines from sources.
# if you are using Mac OS X 10.4.8 or later, you have another option
# 4) use the Accelerate framework which has a multithreaded, tuned LAPACK/BLAS.

# users of the mesa mtx module will have $(LOAD_LAPACK) $(LOAD_BLAS)
# following -lmtx as part of the makefiles for creating their applications.
# by defining these appropriately, you can set things up as you want.


# For case 1), comment out the definitions for WHICH_LAPACK, WHICH_BLAS,
# and LOAD_BLAS.  Define LOAD_LAPACK to load your LAPACK/BLAS library.
# For example, I sometimes use Intel's Math Kernel Library for the Mac.
# To load it, I use the following lines (and comment out the definitions
# for WHICH_LAPACK, WHICH_BLAS, and LOAD_BLAS).

#MKLPATH = /Library/Frameworks/Intel_MKL.framework/Libraries/32
#MKLLIBS = -lmkl_intel -lmkl_intel_thread -lmkl_solver -lmkl_core -lguide -lpthread
#LOAD_LAPACK = -L$(MKLPATH) $(MKLLIBS)

# BTW: just a reminder regarding MKL -- if you are using dynamic lib's, then
# you need to add the path to the MKL/lib to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
# for example, my initialization script includes the following line (without the #)
# setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH /Library/Frameworks/Intel_MKL.framework/Versions/Current/lib/32:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH


# For case 2), define WHICH_LAPACK = USE_SRCS, define LOAD_LAPACK = -lmesalapack
# and comment out WHICH_BLAS.  Define LOAD_BLAS to load your optimized BLAS library.
# For example, I have a version of the Goto BLAS that I've compiled
# for my machine.  To use it, I do the following:

#LOAD_BLAS = -L/Users/bpaxton/GotoBLAS -lgoto


# For case 3), define WHICH_LAPACK = USE_SRCS and LOAD_LAPACK = -lmesalapack.
# Similarly, define WHICH_BLAS = USE_SRCS and LOAD_BLAS = -lmesablas.
# Note that this won't compile all of either BLAS or LAPACK.  It just
# does the routines needed in mesa -- they can be found in mtx directories
# blas_src and lapack_src.


# For case 4), comment out the definitions for WHICH_LAPACK, WHICH_BLAS,
# and LOAD_BLAS.  Define LOAD_LAPACK = -framework accelerate
# for Mac
#WHICH_LAPACK = 
#LOAD_LAPACK = -framework accelerate
#WHICH_BLAS = 
#LOAD_BLAS = 


# this is the standard default
WHICH_LAPACK = USE_SRCS
LOAD_LAPACK = -lmesalapack
WHICH_BLAS = USE_SRCS
LOAD_BLAS = -lmesablas

# step 4) specify optional add-on sparse matrix solvers

# if you do want to use the Super_LU sparse matrix solver, 
# edit the following lines to give the info for your setup.

# if you're not going to be using Super_LU,
# just comment out the following lines.

#USE_SUPERLU = YES
#SUPERLU_DIR = /Users/billpaxton/SuperLU_3.0
#LOAD_SUPERLU = -L$(SUPERLU_DIR) -lsuperlu_3.0
#COMPILE_SUPERLU_C = gcc -O2 -DAdd_ -I$(SUPERLU_DIR)/SRC -c

# if you want to use a c compiler other than gcc,
# you'll need to edit the COMPILE_SUPERLU_C line too.


# what's this Super_LU stuff all about?  Here's the story.
# the solvers in mesa/num are given the matrix factor/solve
# routines as arguments, so you can use sparse matrix versions
# if you'd like.  Sparse solvers come in 2 flavors:
# iterative and direct.  Mesa/mtx includes an iterative
# solver (from the SPARSKIT package), and also has hooks
# for a direct solver (from the Super_LU package).

# for SPARSKIT iterative solvers, mesa/mtx includes both a set
# of routines and the wrappers, so you're all set if that's
# going to be okay for your requirements.
# http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/software/SPARSKIT/sparskit.html

# if you'd prefer to use a direct solver, mesa includes
# hooks for the Super_LU package.  you just need to install
# Super_LU on your machine; the necessary wrappers are
# included in mesa/mtx.  http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/

# if you'd like to try a sparse solver other than these two,
# you'll need to implement the wrapper "decsol" routines.
# Take a look at src/mod_superlu.f to see what's involved.

# BTW: the Watson Sparse Matrix Package is not thread-safe,
# (at least as of Version 8.1), so think twice before deciding
# to use it with mesa.

# Same goes for the HSL Archive code MA28 -- it is also not
# thread safe.  However, the new HSL packages are, and if you
# are in the UK, you can get them without charge.

# Finally, note that at this time, the solvers don't know
# anything about sparse matrices as an option.  As far as
# the solvers are concerned all matrices are either square
# or banded.  So when working with sparse matrices, mesa
# currently builds a full n-by-n jacobian, and then converts
# it to the format required by the sparse matrix package when
# the time comes to use it.   For moderate sized matrices
# such as we expect for even the largest nuclear reaction networks
# (up to 1000 elements or so), this shouldn't be a significant
# overhead.
