    handle encounters.
    
    We have different important scales in the encounter:
    
    1. Small scale of the interaction. This is the smallest distance
       between any two particles in the encounter. Only binaries
       with an aphelion smaller than this distance (times a factor)
       will be handled as a hard binary.
    2. Large scale of the interaction. This is the total diameter of
       the containing sphere of the interaction. For two body interactions
       this is the same as 1. This scale (times a factor)
       will be used to find neighbour particles to include in the handling
       of the encounter.
    3. Initial sphere radius. This is the radius of the sphere containing
       all the particles in the interaction. The sphere itself is centered
       on the center of mass of the particles. This radius is used to
       scale back (or forward) all particles after the interaction 
       calculation is done. 
       
    After an interaction the following should be True of the root 
    particles:
    
    1. The particles are moving apart
    2. The particles on the outside are just insisde the initial sphere
       radius
    3. The distances between all pairs of particles is larger than the 
       small scale of interaction.
