Interface Binding
==========================

Introduction
------------
The binding between the legacy interface and the AMUSE data
model is implemented in the ```binding``` module.

In the AMUSE datamodel a code has one or more sets of
particles. These sets all have the same interface. Each set
provide methods to access the attributes of one or more
particles in a generic way. The binding code is needed
to map this generic interface to the specific interface
provided by the code. The binding code also adds
support for units to the code.
