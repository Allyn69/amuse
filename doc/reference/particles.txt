Datamodel
==========================


Introduction
------------
The AMUSE datamodel is based on sets of particles. 

Different astrophysical objects are all
refered to as Particles in the AMUSE code. 
These objects can be:

* Star
* Black hole
* Gas Particle
* Dark Matter Particle

The astrophysical objects are all modelled using 
the ``Particle`` class . 
Objects of this class can have a varying set of attributes. These 
attributes can be defined by a script or a code.

Sets of particles
------------------
The AMUSE datamodel assumes all particles come in sets. The
data of a particle is stored in the set.


.. automodule:: amuse.support.data.core
    
    .. autoclass:: AbstractParticleSet
        :members:
        
    .. autoclass:: Particles
