.. automodule:: amuse.support.io

    Introduction
    ------------
    The AMUSE framework provides a generic way of reading and writing
    sets of entities (these entities can be particles, gasclouds or
    gridpoints). AMUSE provides a function to write a set to a file
    and a function to read a set from a file. These functions need
    the name of the file and the format of the data in the file. We
    will describe these functions first in this chapter. The functions
    can throw 3 kinds of exceptions, these are described next.
    
    Use
    ---
    
    To write a data set to a space separated text file do:: 
        
        >>> from amuse.support.io import write_set_to_file
        >>> from amuse.support.data.core import Particles
        >>> from amuse.support.units import units
        >>> x = Particles(100)
        >>> x.mass = 10.0 | units.MSun
        >>> x.radius = range(1.0,101.0) | units.RSun
        >>> write_set_to_file(x, "test.csv","txt", attribute_types = [units.MSun, units.RSun])

    Exceptions
    ----------
    
    .. autoclass:: UnsupportedFormatException
    .. autoclass:: CannotSaveException
    .. autoclass:: CannotLoadException
    
    Starlab
    -------
    
    AMUSE has support for reading and writing starlab files::
    
    >>> from amuse.support import io
    >>> particles = io.read_set_from_file('plummer.dyn','starlab')
    >>> io.write_set_to_file(particles, 'output.dyn', 'starlab')
    
    The starlab format support sevaral options, listed below. You can
    use these options as follows:
    
    
    >>> from amuse.support import io
    >>> particles = io.read_set_from_file('plummer.dyn','starlab', must_scale = False, return_children = False)
    
    .. iooptions:: starlab
