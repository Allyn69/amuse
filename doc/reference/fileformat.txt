.. automodule:: amuse.io

    Introduction
    ------------
    The AMUSE framework provides a generic way of reading and writing
    sets of entities (these entities can be particles, gasclouds or
    gridpoints). AMUSE provides a function to write a set to a file
    and a function to read a set from a file. These functions need
    the name of the file and the format of the data in the file. We
    will describe these functions first in this chapter. The functions
    can throw 3 kinds of exceptions, these are described next.
    
    Use
    ---
    
    To write a data set to a space separated text file do:: 
        
        >>> from amuse.io import write_set_to_file
        >>> from amuse.datamodel.core import Particles
        >>> from amuse.units import units
        >>> x = Particles(100)
        >>> x.mass = 10.0 | units.MSun
        >>> x.radius = range(1.0,101.0) | units.RSun
        >>> write_set_to_file(x, "test.csv","txt", attribute_types = [units.MSun, units.RSun])

    Starlab
    -------
    
    AMUSE has support for reading and writing starlab (``.dyn``) files.
    You can specify the starlab format by entering "dyn" or "starlab"
    as the format::
    
        >>> from amuse.support import io
        >>> particles = io.read_set_from_file('plummer.dyn','starlab')
        >>> io.write_set_to_file(particles, 'output.dyn', 'dyn')
    
    The starlab format support sevaral options, listed below. You can
    use these options by adding additional keyword arguments to
    the :func:`read_set_from_file` or :func:`write_set_to_file` functions. 
    For example::
    
        >>> from amuse.support import io
        >>> particles = io.read_set_from_file('plummer.dyn','starlab', must_scale = False, return_children = False)
    
    .. iooptions:: starlab

    The units of the values in the star (stellar properties)
    section of a starlab file are always in derived S.I units (solar
    mass, million years, solar luminocity etc.).
    
    The masses given in de the dynamics section of a starlab file
    are usually in *nbody* units. Some starlab tools will set the
    mass values in Solar mass units (for example the ``makemass``
    tool will return the masses in solar mass units). To read these
    files you need to set the ``dynamics_mass_units``.
    
    .. code-block:: bash
    
        > makeplummer -n 1000 > plummer1.dyn
        > cat plummer1.dyn | makemass -f 1 -x -2.0 -l 0.1 -u 20 > plummer2.dyn
        > cat plummer2.dyn | add_star -Q 0.5 -R 5 > plummer3.dyn
        > cat plummer3.dyn | scale -s > plummer4.dyn
        > cat plummer4.dyn | kira -S > plummer5.dyn
        
    The ``plummer1.dyn``, ``plummer4.dyn`` and ``plummer5.dyn`` files 
    will provide masses (and all other dynamical properties) in scaled
    *nbody* units. The ``plummer2.dyn`` and ``plummer3.dyn`` files
    will have masses in solar masses. To read each file in AMUSE, and
    return the particles with S.I. units, you need to do::
    
    
        >>> from amuse.support import io
        >>> from amuse.units import nbody_system, units
        >>> converter = nbody_system.nbody_to_si(1 | units.MSun, 1 | units.parsec)
        >>> particles1 = io.read_set_from_file('plummer1.dyn','starlab', nbody_to_si_converter = converter)
        >>> particles2 = io.read_set_from_file('plummer2.dyn','starlab', dynamics_mass_units = units.MSun, nbody_to_si_converter = converter)
        >>> particles3 = io.read_set_from_file('plummer3.dyn','starlab', dynamics_mass_units = units.MSun, nbody_to_si_converter = converter)
        >>> particles4 = io.read_set_from_file('plummer4.dyn','starlab')
        >>> particles5 = io.read_set_from_file('plummer5.dyn','starlab')
    
    .. note::
        
        No nbody converter object is needed for the last files, as the scale 
        factors given in the files will be used.
    
    The ``plummer1.dyn``, ``plummer4.dyn`` and ``plummer5.dyn`` can also
    be read in nbody units. In the following example the returned 
    particles have dynamic attributes (mass, radius, velocity, acceleration)
    in *nbody* units::
    
        >>> from amuse.support import io
        >>> particles1 = io.read_set_from_file('plummer1.dyn','starlab')
        >>> particles4 = io.read_set_from_file('plummer4.dyn','starlab', must_scale = False)
        >>> particles5 = io.read_set_from_file('plummer5.dyn','starlab', must_scale = False)
    
    
    NEMO
    ----
    
    AMUSE has support for reading and writing nemo (``.tsf``) files.
    You can specify the starlab format by entering "nemo" or "tsf"
    as the format::
    
        >>> from amuse.support import io
        >>> particles = io.read_set_from_file('plummer.tsf','nemo')
        >>> io.write_set_to_file(particles, 'output.tsf', 'tsf')
        
    The nemo format support several options, listed below. You can
    use these options by adding additional keyword arguments to
    the :func:`read_set_from_file` or :func:`write_set_to_file` functions. 
    For example::
    
        >>> from amuse.support import io
        >>> from amuse.units import nbody_system, units
        >>> converter = nbody_system.nbody_to_si(1 | units.MSun, 1 | units.parsec)
        >>> particles = io.read_set_from_file('plummer.nemo','tsf', nbody_to_si_converter = converter)
        
    .. iooptions:: nemo
        
        
    Gadget
    ------
    
    AMUSE has support for reading and writing gadget 2 files.
    You can specify the gadget format by entering "gadget"
    as the format::
    
        >>> from amuse.support import io
        >>> gas, halo, disk, bulge, stars, bndry = io.read_set_from_file('plummer.dat','gadget')
        >>> io.write_set_to_file(particles, 'output.dat', 'gadget')
    
    The gadget file format reader will return a tuple of gas, halo, disk, 
    bulge, stars and boundary particles. This is different form other
    readers which only return one set. The write_set_to_file can take
    a particles set (will be saved as halo particles) or a tuple of 
    gas, halo, disk, bulge, stars and boundary particles.
    
    The gadget format support several options, listed below. You can
    use these options by adding additional keyword arguments to
    the :func:`read_set_from_file` or :func:`write_set_to_file` functions. 
    For example (will read a gadget file with timestep information)::
    
        >>> from amuse.support import io
        >>> particles = io.read_set_from_file('plummer.nemo','gadget', has_timestep = True)
        
    .. iooptions:: gadget
