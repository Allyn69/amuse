Using the installation scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have created a number of scripts to automate the installation of all pre-requisite packages on a LINUX system. These scripts will download, build and install the packages. After running the scripts you should be able to build almost every MUSE module.

There are installation scripts for the following packages:

* Python (version 2.5.4)
* Swig (version 1.3.39)
* Numpy (version 1.3.0)
* HDF (version 1.8.3)
* h5py (version 1.1.0)
* starlab (version 4.4.4)

The scripts will install all pre-requisite packages in the same directory. This must be a user directory.

The installation scripts have been tested with a bash shell only!

To start the installation do:

1) Open a bash shell

2) Set two environment variables:

# you can choose any prefix directory
export PREFIX=~/amuse/prerequisites

export PATH=${PREFIX}/bin:${PATH}

3) Start the installation scripts (in the given sequence):

./install-python.sh
./install-swig.sh
./install-numpy.sh
./install-starlab.sh
./install-hdf.sh
./install-h5py.sh
./install-nose.sh

4) Update your PATH variable in your start script. Make sure the ${prefix}/bin directory is the first entry in the PATH!

You should now be able to build most MUSE modules.

Installation on OS X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When installing the code on OS.X all steps are the same.The only difference is in setting the PATH variable. The PATH must be extended like this:

export PATH=$PREFIX/Framework/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/bin:$PREFIX/bin:$PATH
