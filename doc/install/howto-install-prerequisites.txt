Installation of the prerequisite software
=========================================

Before installing AMUSE several software packages must be installed. These 
software packages can be installed manually or with two prepared installation
scripts. The installation scripts will install python and the 
other prerequisites in a user directory. No "root" access is required.

These are the packages AMUSE needs:

* Python (version >= 2.6)
* Numpy (version >= 1.3.0)
* HDF (version 1.6.5 - 1.8.3)
* h5py (version >= 1.2.0)
* MPI (OpenMPI or MPICH2)
* mpi4py (version >= 1.0)
* nose (version >= 0.11)


In first the section installation_ we explain how to use the two
installation scripts to install AMUSE. In the last section manual_ 
we have specified the required packages with the needed version for each.

.. _installation:

Compilers
~~~~~~~~~

To build AMUSE from source you need to have a working  build environment.
The AMUSE build system needs a C++ and fortan 90 compiler. Please check first if you
have a working build environment on your system.

In Ubuntu you can setup the environment with (as root):

.. code-block:: sh

	apt-get install build-essential curl g++ gfortran gettext zlib1g-dev



In Fedora you can setup the environment with (as root):

.. code-block:: sh

	yum groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries"


Installation scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have created two installation scripts to automate the installation of
the required packages on a LINUX and OS.X system. These scripts will
install these packages in a user directory. One script downloads and
installs python while the other script downloads and installs the libraries
and python packages. As everything is installed in a user directory these
packages can be installed even if a version of the software is already 
installed on your system. 

The scripts will download and install the software in a user directory. These
user directory must be specified with an ``PREFIX`` environment variable. Before
running the installation scripts you must set the ``PREFIX`` environment 
variable and update the path and library path. For shell (bash) you need to do:

.. code-block:: sh

	export PREFIX=~/amuse/prerequisites
	export PATH=${PREFIX}/bin:${PATH}
  	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PREFIX}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}


One script will download, build and install python on your system. The other 
script is written in Python and will download and install the other packages. 
Both scripts can be found in the ``doc/install`` directory. 

To start the installation do:

.. code-block:: sh

	# 1. Open a shell and go to the <doc/install> directory

	>

	# 2. Set the PREFIX, PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables:

  	> export PREFIX=~/amuse/prerequisites
  	> export PATH=${PREFIX}/bin:${PATH}
  	> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PREFIX}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

	# 3. Start the installation script for python

	> ./install-python.sh

	# 4. Start the installation script for the prerequisite packages

	> ./install.py download
  	> ./install.py install

	# 5. Update your PATH variable in your profile. 
	# Make sure the `${PREFIX}/bin` directory is the first entry in the PATH!

You should now be able to install AMUSE.

Using the installation scripts on OS X
---------------------------------------

When installing the code on OS.X all steps are the same.The only difference 
is in setting the PATH variable. The PATH must be extended like this:

.. code-block:: sh

	export PATH=$PREFIX/Framework/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin:$PREFIX/bin:$PATH

.. _manual:

Manually installing the prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python
-------
Python is probably already installed on your system. To check the version of python do:

.. code-block:: sh

	> python --version
	Python 2.6.2

You can download python from http://www.python.org. 

Numpy
-------
To check if numpy is installed on your system do:

.. code-block:: sh

	> python -c 'import numpy; print numpy.version.version'
	1.3.0

If this fails with an error or a version before 1.3 you need to install numpy.
You can download numpy from http://www.scipy.org/NumPy. 

HDF5 library
------------
HDF5 is a data format specification. The HDF group provides a C library 
to write and access HDF files.

To check if the HDF library is installed on your system do:

.. code-block:: sh

	> h5ls -V
	h5ls: Version 1.8.3

If this fails with an error or a version before 1.6.5 you 
need to install the HDF library. 
You can download HDF from http://www.hdfgroup.org/. 

h5py
----
To access HDF5 files from python we use the ``h5py`` library.

To check if the h5py library is installed on your system do:

.. code-block:: sh

	> python -c 'import h5py; print h5py.version.version'
	1.2.0

If this fails with an error or a version before 1.2.0 you need to install h5py.
You can download h5py from http://code.google.com/p/h5py/. 

MPI
---
The installed MPI framework must be MPI 2 compatible. AMUSE will work with 
MPICH2 or OpenMPI

MPICH2
******
MPICH2 is a portable implementation of the MPI 2 standard.

To check if MPICH2 is installed on your system do:

.. code-block:: sh
    
    > mpdhelp
    
    The following mpd commands are available.  For usage of any specific one,
    invoke it with the single argument --help .

    mpd           start an mpd daemon
    mpdtrace      show all mpd's in ring
    mpdboot       start a ring of daemons all at once
    mpdringtest   test how long it takes 
    ...
    
If this fails with an error you need to install MPICH2 or check for OpenMPI
support.
You can download MPICH2 from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/.

OpenMPI
*******
OpenMPI is another portable implementation of the MPI 2 standard

To check if OpenMPI is installed on your system do:

.. code-block:: sh
    
    > mpicxx -v 
    

If this fails with an error you need to install MPICH2 or OpenMPI
support. Most examples in the dopcumentation assume OpenMPI.
You can download OpenMPI from http://www.open-mpi.org/.

MPI4PY
------
To access MPI from python we use the ``mpi4py`` software.
To check if the mpi4py library is installed on your system do:

.. code-block:: sh

	> python -c 'import mpi4py; print mpi4py.__version__'
	1.0.0

If this fails with an error or a version before 1.0 you need to install mpi4py.
You can download mpi4py from http://code.google.com/p/mpi4py/. 

Nose
-----
Nose is an extension of the python testing framework. It is used for all
unit testing in AMUSE.


To check if Nose is installed on your system do:

.. code-block:: sh
    
    > nosetests --version
    nosetests version 0.11.1
    ...
    
If this fails with an error or a version before 0.11 you need to install nose.
You can download nose from http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/. 


Installing on Ubuntu 9.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we asume a default Ubuntu desktop installation.

Python
------
Ubuntu comes with python2.6 pre-installed, you can check if
python is installed by doing:

.. code-block:: sh

	> python --version
	Python 2.6.2

If this failes with an error or a version before 2.6, please install 
python first(the package is called ``python2.6``). You also need 
the ``python2.6-dev`` development package.
To install it, do::

    > sudo apt-get install python2.6-dev
    

GCC
---
By default, Ubuntu does not install a fortran 90 or a C++ compiler. We
suggest using gfortran and g++. These compilers are installed with
the ``build-essential`` and the ``gfortran`` package. 
To install these, do::

    > sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran

MPI2
----
Ubuntu does not provide installation packages for MPICH2. You can 
build MPICH2 by hand (a good HOWTO can be found at 
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MpichCluster). Or, you can download and install
pre-build packages from the MPICH2 site (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/index.php).

If you prefer OpenMpi over MPICH2, tou can install openmpi
from the Ubuntu packages. To install
the openmpi packages, do::

     > sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin
