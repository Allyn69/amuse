Sets
====

In the datamodel of AMUSE all objects and attributes of objects 
are stored in sets. 

Like the relation database model
--------------------------------
For every object in a set, the set will store the values of the
attributes of the object. This model is like a relation 
database with Tables (sets in AMUSE), Records (an object in the set)
and Columns (an attribute of an object). 

.. graphviz::
    
    digraph layers0 {
      fontsize=10.0;
      node [fontsize=10.0,shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=lightyellow, width=3];
      subgraph cluster0 {
      fontsize=10.0;
            style=filled;
            color=azure2;
            labeljust="l";
            label="AMUSE Model";
            "Set";
            "Object";
            "Attribute";
            "Set" -> "Attribute" [fontsize=10.0,label="stores"];
            "Object" -> "Attribute" [fontsize=10.0,label="has"];
            "Set" -> "Object" [fontsize=10.0,label="contains"];
      } 
      subgraph cluster1 {
      fontsize=10.0;
            style=filled;
            color=azure2;
            labeljust="l";
            label="Relation Database Model";
            "Table";
            "Record";
            "Column";
            "Record" -> "Column" [fontsize=10.0,label="has"];
            "Table" -> "Record" [fontsize=10.0,label="stores"];
      }
    
    }
Objects are views
------------------
Objects in a set do not store any values, instead they refer
to the set to provide their attribute values. In a sense these
objects are points to a location in the set. An object is like
a cursor in a relation database system. It can be used to access
the values of the attributes stored in the set.

.. graphviz::
    
    digraph layers0 {
      fontsize=10.0;
      node [fontsize=10.0, shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=lightyellow, width=3];
      style=filled;
      color=azure2;
      "Set";
      "Object";
      "Object" -> "Set" [fontsize=10.0,label=" pointer to a location in"];
    }

When a user asks an object for its mass the object will query the
set for the stored value and return the answer to the user.

Objects have a key
------------------
The objects in a set can be identified with a unique key. All objects 
having the same key are seen as the same object by the AMUSE system.
The same object can exist is multiple sets. In each set this object
can have a different value of an attribute. Or, in each set a different 
version of the object can exist. 

Storage models
--------------
The actual storage of attribute values in a set is provided by a storage
model.
