Architecture Overview
=====================

Layers
------
The AMUSE architecture is based on a layered design with 3 layers. 
The highest layer is a python script, written for a single problem
or set of problems. The next layer contains the AMUSE code, this layer
provides a library of objects and function to use in the python script. 
The last layer contains all the existing or legacy codes. In this layer
the physical models are implemented.

Each layer builds upon a lower layer, adding functionality or ease of
use to the previous layer:

      }

Each layer has a different role in the AMUSE architecture:

1. **User Script layer**. The code in this layer implements a specific 
   physical problem or sets of problems. This layer contains the 
   example scripts and scripts written by the user. This layer is 
   conceptually comparable to a User Interface layer in applications 
   with a GUI. Coupling two or more codes happens in this layer (with
   the help of support classes from the *Code Layer*.

2. **AMUSE Code layer**. This layer provides an object oriented 
   interface on top of the legacy codes. It also provides a library
   of functionalities, such as unit handling and data conversion.
   The role of this layer is very generic, it is not specific 
   for one problem or for one physical domain.
   
3. **Legacy Codes layer**.  This layer defines the interfaces
   to the legacy codes and contains the existing codes. It provides 
   process management for the legacy codes and functional
   interfaces to the codes. The code in this layer is generic in 
   respect to problems, but specific for different physical domains.

The following sections contain a detailed explanation of the layers,
starting with the lowest layer to the highest. Some details are further
worked out in other chapters or in the reference manual.

Legacy codes layer
******************

The **Legacy Codes layer** contains the existing applications and 
the functionality to interface with these applications. This
layer exposes every legacy code as a set of functions. These 
functions are grouped in one class per code.

The AMUSE framework code and the legacy codes are designed to be run 
as separate applications. The AMUSE framework code consists of a python
script and the AMUSE library. The legacy codes consists of 
the original code-base extended with a new main application that
handles messages send to it from the python library. 
Function calls into the legacy codes are send via a *message passing framework* 
to the actual running codes.

The number of applications started and the machines on which these
run can all be set dynamically in AMUSE. Depending on the problem
a researcher can run all of AMUSE on a single desktop computer
or in a mixed environment with clusters of computers. Every AMUSE run
starts with one python script. This script can in turn start
a number of different legacy codes (as separate applications). The
legacy codes run on 1 single computer or on a cluster of computers.
A complete run can consist of multiple applications running in parallel
or sequence and managed by one python script.

        "Python Script" -> "Stellar Evolution 4";
        
    }

Message passing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The amuse framework interacts with legacy codes via a message passing
framework. Function calls in the python scripts are translated
to messages and these messages are send to the legacy codes 
using the message passing framework . The legacy codes wait 
for message events and will decode the message upon arrival and 
perform the requested function. The results will be send back 
using a similar message.

AMUSE Code layer
****************

The **Code layer** is responsible for providing an object
oriented interface to the legacy codes. It also provides extra 
functionality to help write a user script, such as file input 
and output of common file formats and unit conversions. These
extra functionalities can be used independent of the legacy codes.

Every legacy code has a *low-level* interface (defined in the legacy
interface layer) and an *object-oriented* interface. The *low-level*
interface is defined as as set of functions. The *object-oriented* interface
uses these functions and combines these with models for state-transitions,
units and data sets to provide an interface that is easier to use (less error
prone) and easier to couple with other codes.

    digraph amcode_0{
      fontsize=10.0;
        compound=true;
        ranksep=1;
        
        node [fontsize=10.0,shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=lightyellow];
        subgraph cluster0 {
            style=filled;
            color=azure2;
            label="Object Oriented Interface";
            "Unit Conversion";
            "Code Interface";
            "State";
            "Exceptions";
        }
        
        subgraph cluster1 {
            style=filled;
            color=azure2;
            label="Data Model";
            "Particles" ;
            "Grid Points";
        }
        "Legacy Interface";
        "Code Interface" -> "Legacy Interface"[ ltail=cluster0];
        subgraph cluster2 {
            style=filled;
            color=azure2;
            label="Support";
            
            "Input/Ouput";
            "Units";
        }
        
        "Code Interface" -> "Particles"[lhead=cluster1, ltail=cluster0]; 
        "Code Interface" -> "Units"[lhead=cluster2, ltail=cluster0]; 
    }

Model of a legacy code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The legacy codes of every module in all physical domains are modelled using
the same template. The template consists of attributes and wrappers. **Attributes**
provide a common interface for sub-parts of the code, for example the *particles*
attribute provides an interface to add, update and remove the particles in
a code. Attributes combine several functions in a legacy interface into
one object.  **Wrappers** are defined on top of the legacy functions and
add functionality to existing methods. For example for every method 
the units of the arguments and return values can be defined in a filter.
Wrappers add functionality to individual methods.


Attributes
++++++++++
The template divides the interface object of a code into
a number of attributes. Each attribute refers to an object implementing
a specific sub-interface of the code. For example a code can have a
*parameter* attribute, this attribute implements the *ParameterSet* 
sub-interface. The *ParameterSet* sub-interface defines how to
interact with the parameters of a code (in this case each parameter
can be set or queried from the set by name using normal python attribute access).

The *template* for all codes is divided into the following sub-interfaces:

parameters
    Parameters influence how the code works. Parameters are usually
    set just after creating a code. Parameters should be read-write
    or write-only.
    
properties
    Properties inform the user about the state of the code. The
    current model time is a property. Properties are always read-only.

particle sets
    Particle sets provide a common interface for a set of particles
    in the code. A code can have multiple particle sets defined under
    different names (for example gas, stars and dark matter)

grids
    Grids provide access to multi-dimensional data. A code can
    have multiple grids defined in a hierarchy (for AMR or SMR codes)


Wrappers
+++++++

Wrappers decorate a method. Wrappers can do pre- and post-processing of
the arguments or decide if a method can savely be called.

units and error code
    Defines a unit for each argument of the wrapped method. When called
    the arguments will be converted to numbers in the correct unit. The
    return values will be converted to quantities (numbers with a unit).
    
state
    The state of a code determines which functions are valid to call
    and how the code can transfer from one state into another. A code
    might give incorrect answers if the potential energy is requested before
    the particles are entered into the code.
    
Implementation
++++++++++++++

The implementation of the *object-oriented* interface is based on the adaptor 
pattern. A *Legacy interface* class is adapted to create a
class which provides *"parameters"*, *"particle sets/gridpoints"* , 
*"methods with units"* , *"properties with units"* , 
*"state control"* and *"Unit conversions for incompatible unit systems"*. 
Each functionality has the same interface for all codes in the system.

User Script
***********

The final layer is the **User Script Layer** this layer contains 
all the scripts written by a researcher for a specific 
problem or set of problems. These scripts are always written
in *python* and can use all the functionality provided by the two
lower layers in the AMUSE framework. The scripts don't need to 
follow a fixed design.
