==================================
Setting values for grid boundaries
==================================

.. note::

    At the time of writing of this tutorial (september 2012), only the
    Athena hydrodynamics code supports the user defined boundaries.
    
In AMUSE, you can specify how a hydrodynamics grid code handles the 
boundary conditions. Hydrodynamic grid codes define a number of 
special grid cells at all ends of the grid. These cells are often 
called boundary or ghost cells and are handled differently by the 
code. The flow-variables in these cells are not evolved but 
calculated from other cells or from a user defined function.

Each code in amuse will need to provide at least 3 kinds of boundary 
conditions:

periodic
    To simulate periodically repeating problems. Periodic boundary 
    conditions simulates as if the grid is connected to a copy of 
    itself, often implemented by copying over the data at the 
    opposite site of the grid to the boundary cells.
reflect
    Mirrors all grid variables in the boundary cells, often 
    implemented by copying the data of the cells connected to the 
    boundary into the boundary cells.
outflow
    Sets the derivative of the flow variables with respect to the 
    direction of the boundary to zero.

The following picture shows all three boundary conditions for a one
dimensional grid with 4 boundary cells:
